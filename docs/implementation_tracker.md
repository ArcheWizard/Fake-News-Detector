# Implementation Tracker

This file tracks the implementation of improvements for the Fake News Detector project.

## Sprint 1 Progress (Completed: October 22, 2025)

### ✅ Testing

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Coverage**: 90%+ for core modules
- **Details**:
  - Created `tests/test_data_comprehensive.py` with 15 comprehensive tests
  - Created `tests/test_metrics_comprehensive.py` with 17 comprehensive tests
  - Data loading module: 90% coverage
  - Metrics module: 91% coverage
  - All 32 tests passing

### ✅ Error Handling

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Created `src/fnd/exceptions.py` with custom exception hierarchy
  - Implemented: FNDException, DataLoadError, InsufficientDataError, ModelLoadError, ConfigurationError, EvaluationError, ExplainabilityError
  - Enhanced `datasets.py` with detailed error messages and validation checks
  - Added comprehensive checks for: missing directories, missing files, empty datasets, insufficient data, class imbalance

### ✅ Documentation

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Added Google-style docstrings to all functions in `src/fnd/data/datasets.py`
  - Added comprehensive docstrings to `src/fnd/training/metrics.py`
  - Added detailed docstrings to `src/fnd/models/factory.py`
  - All docstrings include: Args, Returns, Raises, Examples, Notes
  - Documentation covers edge cases and best practices

## Remaining Suggestions

- [ ] Code Duplication
  - Create centralized model loading utilities
  - Consolidate duplicate code across web app and API

- [ ] Configuration Management
  - Implement YAML-based configuration system
  - Add CLI override support

- [ ] Modularization
  - Further separate training and evaluation logic
  - Create utility modules for common operations

- [ ] Data Handling
  - Consider efficient data handling for large datasets
  - Potential Dask/PySpark integration

- [ ] Model Optimization
  - Implement model pruning/quantization
  - Add mixed precision training support

- [ ] User Interface
  - Enhance Streamlit UI interactivity
  - Better visualization of results

- [ ] Explainability
  - Better integration of SHAP/LIME in UI
  - Add visualization for explanations

- [ ] Multilingual Support
  - Implement multilingual model support (mBERT)
  - Add language detection

- [ ] Version Control
  - Regular meaningful commits (ongoing)

- [ ] CI/CD
  - Set up GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing and linting
  - Coverage reporting
