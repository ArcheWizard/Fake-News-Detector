  - Implemented: FNDException, DataLoadError, InsufficientDataError, ModelLoadError, ConfigurationError, EvaluationError, ExplainabilityError
  - Enhanced `datasets.py` with detailed error messages and validation checks
  - Added comprehensive checks for: missing directories, missing files, empty datasets, insufficient data, class imbalance

### ✅ Documentation

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Added Google-style docstrings to all functions in `src/fnd/data/datasets.py`
  - Added comprehensive docstrings to `src/fnd/training/metrics.py`
  - Added detailed docstrings to `src/fnd/models/factory.py`
  - All docstrings include: Args, Returns, Raises, Examples, Notes

## Sprint 2 Progress (Completed: October 22, 2025)

### ✅ Configuration Management

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Coverage**: 30 tests passing
- **Details**:
  - Created `src/fnd/config.py` with dataclass-based configuration system
  - Implemented hierarchical config: FNDConfig, TrainConfig, EvalConfig, DataConfig, PathsConfig
  - YAML loading with `FNDConfig.from_yaml()`
  - CLI override support with underscore notation (e.g., `train_epochs=5`)
  - Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
  - Config saving with `to_yaml()` method
  - Created `tests/test_config.py` with 30 comprehensive tests
  - All tests passing with full validation coverage

### ✅ Code Duplication

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Created `src/fnd/models/utils.py` with centralized model utilities
  - Implemented `load_model_and_tokenizer_from_dir()` for consistent model loading
  - Implemented `create_classification_pipeline()` for unified inference
  - Implemented `load_label_mapping()` for label mapping extraction
  - Implemented `get_model_info()` for model metadata
  - Comprehensive error handling with ModelLoadError
  - Detailed docstrings with examples for all functions

## Remaining Suggestions

- [x] Modularization
  - ✅ Refactor train.py to use config system
  - ✅ Refactor evaluate.py to use config system
  - ✅ Update web app and API to use model utilities
  - Further separate training and evaluation logic (optional)
  - Create utility modules for common operations (optional)

- [ ] Advanced Features
  - [ ] Implement model pruning or quantization for performance
  - [ ] Add multilingual support (mBERT)
  - [ ] Integrate SHAP/LIME into UI
  - [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Sprint 3 Progress (Completed: October 22, 2025)

### ✅ Integration of Configuration System

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Refactored `src/fnd/training/train.py` to use FNDConfig with YAML and CLI overrides
  - Added `--run_name` parameter for organizing training runs
  - Now loads all hyperparameters from config/config.yaml with optional CLI overrides
  - Automatically saves configuration alongside model artifacts
  - Refactored `src/fnd/eval/evaluate.py` to use config system
  - Made config optional in evaluate.py for backward compatibility
  - All 65 tests still passing

### ✅ Integration of Model Utilities

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Details**:
  - Updated `src/fnd/web/app.py` to use `create_classification_pipeline()` from utils
  - Updated `src/fnd/api/main.py` to use `create_classification_pipeline()` from utils
  - Eliminated duplicate model loading code across web app and API
  - Consistent error handling and model loading behavior across all components

- [ ] Data Handling
  - Consider efficient data handling for large datasets
  - Potential Dask/PySpark integration

- [ ] Model Optimization
  - Implement model pruning/quantization
  - Add mixed precision training support

- [ ] User Interface
  - Enhance Streamlit UI interactivity
  - Better visualization of results

- [ ] Explainability
  - Better integration of SHAP/LIME in UI
  - Add visualization for explanations

- [ ] Multilingual Support
  - Implement multilingual model support (mBERT)
  - Add language detection

- [ ] Version Control
  - Regular meaningful commits (ongoing)

- [ ] CI/CD
  - Set up GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing and linting
  - Coverage reporting
