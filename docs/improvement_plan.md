# Fake News Detector Project Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the areas for improvement in the Fake News Detector project, including redundancies, best practices, complexity, performance, features, and best case practices.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Redundancies

- **Code Duplication**: Centralize model loading and utility functions.
- **Configuration Management**: Choose one method for configuration (command-line arguments or YAML).

### 2. Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Improve inline comments and docstrings for clarity.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for critical functions using `pytest`.

### 3. Complexity

- **Modularization**: Separate training and evaluation logic more distinctly.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling with custom exceptions.

### 4. Performance

- **Data Handling**: Use efficient data handling techniques (Dask or PySpark).
- **Model Optimization**: Implement model pruning or quantization.

### 5. Features

- **User Interface**: Enhance the Streamlit UI for interactivity.
- **Explainability**: Integrate SHAP or LIME explanations into the UI.
- **Multilingual Support**: Implement support for multiple languages.

### 6. Best Case Practices

- **Version Control**: Regularly commit changes with meaningful messages.
- **CI/CD**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
